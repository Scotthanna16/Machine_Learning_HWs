# Machine_Learning_HWs
Hello, this is the Repository for the Machine Learning Course. There are 3 projects in it.

The first project was implementing Gradient Descent. We implemented the cost function and gradient descent algorithms in the gd.py file. After doing this for basic linear regression, I focsed on multivariate regression. Again, I implemented the cost function, then two different versions of the gradient descent algorithm. First using the Normal Equations, and a second vectorized gradient descent. Finally, I used feature normalization to improve the speed at which the algorithm converges.
